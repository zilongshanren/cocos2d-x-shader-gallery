# How to Use

You can put this project under your cocos2d-x root's projects folder.(I use Walzer's amazing create_project.py to create 

these cross-platform projects. You can refer to [this](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/projects/cocos2d-x/wiki/How_to_create_a_multi-platform_project_in_one_command_line)for more information.)

Now I only add ios and android support, more version will be added in the future. Hope you guys will contribute.
